**Data Analysis Practice based on Men's 2018 FIFA rankings**

In this practice project, I compared the beginning of the year rankings to the end of the year rankings and analyzed how teams changed and the factors contributing to those changes

Compiling the Data:
- Download January and December rankings from FiFA rankings website systematically
- Clean the January and December rankings
- Join them into one dataframe and clean the data after merged

Questions Asked:
- Top ranked and best performers: broken down by points, point changes, rank changes, classifying them into various groups or classifications?
- Are points accrued the main factor affecting rankings?

For Analysis, I did some exploratory data analysis using the variables and created a few variables too; finally, some regression testing, hypothesis testing and concluding the results.
